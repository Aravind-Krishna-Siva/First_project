    <h1>The Greatness of Arunachala Siva</h1>

    <p>
        Arunachala Siva represents the eternal truth, inner silence, and the divine
        light that guides humanity toward self-realization. Arunachala is not merely
        a mountain but a living embodiment of Lord Siva Himself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Devotees believe that circumambulating Arunachala dissolves karma, purifies
        the soul, and leads one closer to liberation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Arunachala Siva teaches that true greatness lies in stillness, surrender,
        and unwavering devotion. His presence inspires humility, compassion, and
        the realization that the divine resides within all beings.
